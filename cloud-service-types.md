# Types of cloud services
- Explore the three categories of cloud computing: IaaS versus PaaS versus SaaS

## Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- Infrastructure as a Service is the most flexible category of cloud services.
- It aims to give you the most control over the provided hardware that runs your application (IT infrastructure servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, and operating systems)
- Instead of buying hardware, with IaaS, you rent it. It's an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet.
- IaaS is commonly used in the following scenarios:
  - Migrating workloads. Typically, IaaS facilities are managed in a similar way as on-premises infrastructure and provide an easy migration path for moving existing applications to the cloud.
  - Test and development. Teams can quickly set up and dismantle test and development environments, bringing new applications to market faster. IaaS makes scaling development and testing environments, fast and economical.
  - Storage, backup, and recovery. Organizations avoid the capital outlay and complexity of storage management, which typically requires skilled staff to manage data and meet `legal and compliance requirements`. IaaS is useful for managing unpredictable demand and steadily growing storage needs. IaaS can also simplify the planning and management of backup and recovery systems.

## Platform as a service (PaaS)
- PaaS provides an environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications.
- The goal of PaaS is to help you create an application quickly without managing the underlying infrastructure
- For example, when deploying a web application using PaaS, you don't have to install an operating system, web server, or even system updates.
-  Resources are purchased from a cloud service provider on a `pay-as-you-go` basis and accessed over a secure Internet connection.
- PaaS is commonly used in the following scenarios:
  - Development framework
    - PaaS provides a framework that developers can build upon to develop or customize cloud-based applications
    -  Just like Microsoft Excel macro, PaaS lets developers create applications using built-in software components. Cloud features such as scalability, high-availability, and multi-tenant capability are included, reducing the amount of coding that developers must do.
  - Analytics or business intelligence
    - Tools provided as a service with PaaS allow organizations to analyze and mine their data.
    - They can find insights and patterns, and predict outcomes to improve business decisions such as forecasting, product design, and investment returns.

## Software as a service (SaaS)
- SaaS is software that is centrally hosted and managed for the end customer
- It is usually based on an architecture where one version of the application is used for all customers,and licensed through a monthly or annual subscription
- Microsoft 365, Skype, and Dynamics CRM Online are perfect examples of SaaS software.
